File structure for this homework:
- folder scale_aware_optimization: implementation of q1
- folder jump_aware_optimization: implementation of q2
- output.txt: container of optimization output
- visual.py: visualizer of output and GT

to run and see the visualization, you need to enter the build folder for that question, run `./g2o_optimization`, then the optimization result will be saved in output.txt under main folder, you can use visual.py to see the comparison between my result and GT.
